# Grant Lab Rotation
A repository to keep track of progress with CMI-PB Pertussis Modeling Challenge during Grant Lab rotation.


For setting up data pre-processing (Step1 and Step2 qmd files), you will need to setup three directories (objects, raw_prediction_dataset, raw_training_dataset) in the working directory prior - as seen below. The raw prediction and training datasets within the respective directories can be found [here](https://www.cmi-pb.org/downloads/cmipb_challenge_datasets/current/2nd_challenge/raw_datasets/) in tsv format. Additionally, for the above qmd files to run, it is imperative 'codebase.R' and 'gene_90_38_export.tsv' must be downloaded in the working directory. These files can be found in this repo.
